D980tw will be the servo we use

another buffer lol

NXP 74AHC244APWJ
need to use 3.3V instead of 5V since the VIH for 5V is 3.15V (not enough margin)
$5/pc

buffer that support TTL logic level.
$16/pc

buck converter
LM3150 @ 10A output (design from ti webench)
use 2 power stage, 1 for 2 high load monster torque, 4 "normal" load servo

SRP6030CA-3R3M

current sensor use INA2180A2

Resistor use 12mR with <=2% tolerance with >300mW

ADC use ADS1118 (4 ch input with SPI 3.3kSPS) SPI clock need to be <=100kHz
input +-4.096V (only half of the bits are used)

programming: Need to 


servo king and moster torque need 1 type of servo board that needs PWM + 24V to 6-7V 10A buck
need 1 current sensor for every 2 servo or 4 servo in low power mode
need 1 current sensor for every 1 servo in high power mode

Dymapixel board:
need 24V to 11V buck converter
need a RS485 to usb transceiver
can ask ken to make that board
